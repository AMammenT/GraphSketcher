# GraphSketcher

A fast, simple graph drawing and data plotting app for OS X and iPad.

## Introduction

GraphSketcher is a simple, elegant tool for quickly sketching graphs and plotting data — but you don’t even need data to get started. It’s perfect for reports, presentations, and problem sets where you need to produce sharp-looking graphs on the fly.

## Setting it Free

Graph Sketcher was created by Robin Stewart in 2007. The Omni Group further developed OmniGraphSketcher for Mac and brought it to the iPad in 2010. All GraphSketcher-related source code was open-sourced in 2014.

##What’s Inside

The Mac app is located inside the `App` folder; the iPad source is in the `iPad` folder. Shared code exists in `Model` and `OmniStyle`.
