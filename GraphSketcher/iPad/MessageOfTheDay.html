		<h1>
			Welcome to GraphSketcher 2
		</h1>
		<p>
			GraphSketcher is a simple, elegant tool for quickly sketching graphs and plotting data — but you don’t even need data to get started. It’s <span class="yellow">perfect for reports, presentations, and problem sets</span> where you need to produce sharp-looking graphs on the fly.
		</p>
		<p>
			GraphSketcher 2 is the first open-source release and requires iOS7. The following are changes from OmniGraphSketcher for iPad 1.7.x:
		</p>
		<ul>
            <li class="addition">Incorporated a new iOS7-style document browser that supports folders and <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnipresence/">OmniPresence</a> syncing.
            <li class="change">The application bundle ID is now <code>com.graphsketcher.GraphSketcher.iPad</code>.</li>
            <li class="change">Replaced the application icon with a version that doesn't include the Omni logo.
            </li>
			<li class="change">Replaced the Omni About panel with a generic one.
			</li>
			<li class="change">Miscellaneous code changes and improvements (archiving, memory management, etc).
			</li>
			<li class="change">Removed 99.9% of Omni Group &amp; OmniGraphSketcher references; let us know if you find any that slipped by.
			</li>
			<li class="addition">Open sourced GraphSketcher under our the same MIT-style license as our <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/developer"> Objective-C Frameworks</a>. All license references <em>should </em> reflect this license (again, please let us know).</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
