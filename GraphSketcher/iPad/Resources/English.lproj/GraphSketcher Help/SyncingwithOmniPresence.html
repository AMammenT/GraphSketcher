                <div class="item "><span class=""><strong>OmniPresence</strong> is a way to store your documents in the cloud and sync them with other devices. To use OmniPresence you'll need: <strong>(1)</strong> this copy of GraphSketcher and <strong>(2)</strong> access to a standard WebDAV server such as the <a href="https://manage.sync.omnigroup.com">Omni Sync Server</a> (signup is free!). The Apache server included with Mountain Lion Server and WebDAV servers available through many web hosting providers are also great options if you'd prefer to set up your own. If you would like to sync your GraphSketcher documents with your Mac you'll also need <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnipresence">OmniPresence for Mac</a>.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/cloudsetup.png" width="313pt" class="inline-image-wrap-right" style="padding:5px;">To start using OmniPresence, tap the Local Documents title in the toolbar and choose <strong>Cloud Setup</strong>.</span>                    </div>
          
                <div class="item "><span class="">First pick the type of account you'd like to create. Enter the server's location (if necessary) and your login information, and choose either <strong>OmniPresence</strong> or <strong>Both</strong> as your account type. (Choosing Both will give access to standard WebDAV import/export as well as OmniPresence sync. Be careful: files stored in a remote import/export location will <strong>NOT</strong> be synced!).</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">When you're ready, tap <strong>Connect</strong>. GraphSketcher will check to make sure the server is compatible with OmniPresence, and then your new folder will be connected to the cloud.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">After connecting you'll find yourself looking at an empty cloud folder. To sync files stored locally you can use the <strong>Move All Local Documents</strong> button, or for individual documents:</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class=""><strong>1.</strong> Tap the title in the toolbar and choose Local Documents.</span>                    </div>
                <div class="item "><span class=""><strong>2.</strong> Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the toolbar, and tap to select the documents you'd like to move.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class=""><strong>3.</strong> Tap <strong>Share</strong>, then <strong>Move to "(folder name)"</strong>. The files will be moved from Local Documents to your cloud sync folder.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">Files stored in an OmniPresence-enabled  folder will sync automatically whenever changes are made to them. To stop syncing a file, just move it back to Local Documents. To disconnect a synced folder from GraphSketcher, go to Cloud Setup and tap <strong>Edit</strong> to delete the folder from your list of OmniPresence accounts. Note that this won't delete any remaining contents of the folder; the files will remain in the cloud, but won't be affected by changes on this device.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <strong>OmniPresence</strong> button appears in the toolbar when viewing a synced folder in the document browser as well as when editing a document in a synced folder. It animates to indicate a sync is in process, and if needed you can tap it to prompt a sync as well.</span>               </div>
