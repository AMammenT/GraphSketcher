                <div class="item "><span class="">If an object isn&#8217;t quite where you&#8217;d like it to be or its style isn&#8217;t all that stylin&#8217;, it&#8217;s easy to make a change. First, make sure you're not in <a href="DrawingLinesandPointsinDrawMode.html">Draw</a> or <a href="DrawingFillsinFillMode.html">Fill mode</a> by tapping the <strong>Done</strong> button on the toolbar. (If it's not there, you're good to go!)</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">To move an object, touch and hold the object, then drag. To move an object one pixel at a time: touch and hold the object, then swipe with a second finger the direction in which you'd like the object to move. </span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">To make style and property changes, tap the object you&#8217;d like to adjust. Tapping the object selects it; you can select individual points or a whole line or fill, including all of its points. To select all objects on the canvas: touch and hold the canvas; when its contextual menu appears, tap <strong>Select All</strong>. To select at least two (but not all) objects, drag across the canvas or touch and hold one object and tap the others. Once an object is selected, you can use the <a href="UsingtheInfoPopover.html">Info popover</a> to change the selection&#8217;s appearance and attributes &#8212; for example, color &#8212; or to type in a precise location.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">To delete an object: touch and hold the object; when its contextual menu appears, tap <strong>Delete</strong>.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">To copy an object: touch and hold the object; when its contextual menu appears, tap <strong>Copy</strong>.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">To paste an object: touch and hold the canvas; when its contextual menu appears, tap <strong>Paste</strong>.</span>                    </div>
                
                <div class="item "><span class="">You can also use the contextual menu to lock or unlock and detach objects. A locked object remains in its current position and cannot be moved or resized. An unlocked object can be moved and resized freely. Use detach to separate an object from an item to which it's attached so that it can be moved about without taking anything else along for the ride.</span>                    </div>
