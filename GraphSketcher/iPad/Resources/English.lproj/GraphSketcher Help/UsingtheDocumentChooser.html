                <div class="item "><span class="">The <strong>Document Browser</strong> is for browsing and managing your documents; you can make a new graph, preview existing graphs, and share, duplicate, or delete your files. You can also import and export graphs from remote servers, and set up OmniPresence file syncing to keep documents up to date between all versions of OmniGraphSektcher. To enter the Document Browser while viewing a graph, press the <strong>Documents</strong> button on the toolbar.</span>                    </div>

                <div class="item "><span class="">To import a graph from a remote location, tap <strong>Local Documents</strong> and choose Cloud Setup. From here you can create a new account or access an existing account for remote storage or syncing (see the next page for more on OmniPresence sync). To create or access existing Omni Sync Server or WebDAV storage, choose the <strong>Import/Export</strong> option when setting up your account.</span>                    </div>
