                    <span class="">With a name like GraphSketcher, you might find yourself wanting to sketch some graphs! For that, use <strong>Draw mode</strong>. To get into Draw mode, just tap the <strong>Draw tool</strong> in the toolbar. (The Draw tool is the skinny pen drawing the line.) </span>

                    <span class="">While in Draw mode, you have several ways of making points (and connecting them with lines) to quickly bring your graph to life:</span>

                    <div class="item ">
                        <span class="">Drag across the canvas to draw a freehand line. GraphSketcher does its best to create a smooth line that matches the one you drew.</span>

                    <div class="item ">
                        <span class="">To create a line point-by-point, tap once for each point. (A line is drawn between them automatically.) To finish the line, tap the last point a second time.</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item ">
                        <span class="">To create an individual point (without a line): tap the canvas, then tap the newly created point. The first tap will create the point and the second will finish drawing so that you don't make a line with your next tap. If the point doesn't quite land where you want, drag your finger around before letting go in order to adjust it.</span>
