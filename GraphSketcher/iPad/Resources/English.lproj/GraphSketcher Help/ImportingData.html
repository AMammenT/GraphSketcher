                <div class="item "><span class="">Make sure your data is in the form of columns. Reliable sources include HTML tables in Safari, cells in Numbers, or text that is separated by commas or tabs. If your columns have headers, the headers will label the axes.</span>

                <div class="item "><span class="">Once your data is copied, open GraphSketcher. Create a new document or open an existing graph. Then, tap the canvas. Tap <strong>Paste</strong> and GraphSketcher will do its best to visualize your input, based on these possibilities:</span>

If your data consists of four columns (one column of x-values followed by three columns of y-values), GraphSketcher makes it easy to create error bars that visualize the data as positive and negative offsets.</span>
