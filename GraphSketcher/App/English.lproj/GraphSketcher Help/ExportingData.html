        <h2>Exporting Data</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">You can export your graph in a number of image formats, and you can also get your numerical data out.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The easiest way to get your graph as an image is to click the Copy As Image toolbar button or choose Copy Graph as Image from the Edit menu. Then, you can just paste it into another application.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">To create an image file of your graph, use the Export command in the File menu and choose the format that meets your needs.</span>                    </div>

                    <ul class="item List">                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class=""><span class="Bold">PDF</span> (Portable Document Format) is a lovely vector-based image format that crisply preserves the form of your graph at any size, and is the best choice for printing or for using with modern Mac applications. It cannot be embedded in a web page, though.</span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class=""><span class="Bold">PNG</span> (Portable Network Graphics) is a bitmap (pixel-based) image format that will faithfully reproduce your graph, but only at the particular pixel dimensions it had on your screen when you created it. This format works well for the Web, as it is understood by all decent web browsers.</span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class=""><span class="Bold">JPEG</span> is a bitmap (pixel-based) image format that may introduce some tiny visual artifacts into your graph. But, it is more widely supported than PNG or PDF, and may come in handy when working with older or less savvy applications.</span>                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">If you just want the data points from your graph, you can copy it from the <a href="help:anchor='datapointsinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Data Points inspector</a> and paste it into a spreadsheet, text editor, or outliner application.</span>                    </div>
