        <h2>The Canvas Inspector</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">The Canvas inspector controls the dimensions and appearance of the drawing area for your graph. To open it, click the third tab in the inspector. If the inspector isn&rsquo;t open, choose <span class="Bold">Canvas</span> from the <span class="Bold">Inspectors</span> menu.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">Click the <span class="Bold">Color</span> well to open the standard Mac color panel and choose a background color for your graph. You can even choose partially transparent colors, if you need to <a href="help:anchor='export' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">export</a> a copy of your graph to overlay on top of something else.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">If you must add shadows to your graph, you can do so with the <span class="Bold">Shadows</span> slider. But take heed: information visualization experts frown upon such frippery.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Canvas Size</span> fields show the dimensions of your window, in points. You can just resize the window, of course, but these fields give you precise control in case you are aiming for a very particular size. If you need to make a much bigger or much smaller final product than your screen will accommodate, you can <a href="help:anchor='export' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">export</a> as PDF and then use a graphics application to scale it.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Margins</span> section controls the area of the canvas outside your graph. For the most part, you can let GraphSketcher automatically set your margins for you, based on the size and distance of your <a href="help:anchor='axislabels' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">axis labels</a>. But if you need more space (to add annotations, for instance), you can deselect the <span class="Bold">Automatic</span> checkbox and enter specific values. (You could also drag the magenta <a href="help:anchor='guides' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">guides</a> that appear when you put the mouse pointer over one of the margins.)</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Window Transparancy </span>slider controls the opacity of your canvas so that you can trace another graph or compare the graph you've drawn to another window behind it. Move the slider to the left for a clear background and to the right for an opaque background.</span>                    </div>
