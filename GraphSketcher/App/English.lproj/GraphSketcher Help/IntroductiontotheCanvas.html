        <h2>Introduction to the Canvas</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Toolbar</span> at the top of the window contains buttons for GraphSketcher&rsquo;s four tools (<a href="help:anchor='modify' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Modify</a>, <a href="help:anchor='draw' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Draw</a>, <a href="help:anchor='fill' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Fill</a>, and <a href="help:anchor='text' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Text</a>) and some common commands. You can add, remove, or rearrange buttons by choosing <span class="Bold">Customize Toolbar</span> from the <span class="Bold">View</span> menu. Show and hide the toolbar by clicking the white button in the upper-right corner of the window.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Axes</span> define the visible ranges of your data. There are several ways to <a href="help:anchor='customizetheaxes' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">customize the axes</a>&rsquo; numerical ranges, appearance, and position.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Margins</span> are the area between the edge of your graph and the edge of the canvas. If you put the mouse pointer near the inside of the margin, a magenta guide appears; you can drag it to adjust the margin. Because the axes lie on that same line, you may need to go near the corner of the window to adjust these guides. You can also adjust the margins in the <a href="help:anchor='canvasinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Canvas inspector</a>.</span>                    </div>

<a name="axislabels"></a>
<a name="axisticks"></a>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Axis Labels</span> on the two axes, and the <span class="Bold">Tick Labels</span> delineating values along the axes, can also be edited. Double-click a label to edit it. (You can edit a tick label at the edge of the graph to quickly <a href="help:anchor='adjustaxisranges' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">adjust axis ranges</a>.) Click a label and then use the <a href="help:anchor='styleinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Style inspector</a> to change its appearance. You can also show or hide these labels with the <a href="help:anchor='axesinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Axes inspector</a>.</span>                    </div>

<a name="guides"></a>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">As you draw or manipulate objects on the canvas, blue <span class="Bold">Guides</span> apppear to help you arrange and align them. These guides correspond to the <a href="help:anchor='axisticks' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">axis ticks</a>, so you can adjust the ticks to make the guides more coarse or more precise. If you prefer not to have your drawing constrained by the guides, you can turn off the <span class="Bold">Snap to Grid</span> setting in the Arrange menu.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Status Bar</span> at the bottom of the window gives contextual, possibly-interesting information.</span>                    </div>

                    <ul class="item List">                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">If nothing is selected: the precise coordinates of the mouse pointer in the graph.</span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">If nothing is selected and the mouse pointer is outside the canvas: the dimensions of the canvas in pixels and in inches (assuming 72 dots per inch).</span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">If a single point is selected: the point&rsquo;s coordinates.</span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">If multiple points are selected: the points&rsquo; average coordinates. </span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">If a two-point line is selected: The linear equation that describes the line.</span>                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">If you click and drag the lower-right corner of the window to resize it, the canvas scales along with it. That is, a document is always exactly as big as its window, so there is no need to zoom or scroll. (If you just want to adjust the margins without changing the size of the graph, hold Command while you drag.) You can adjust the canvas size to particular pixel values with the <a href="help:anchor='canvasinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Canvas inspector</a>.</span>                    </div>
