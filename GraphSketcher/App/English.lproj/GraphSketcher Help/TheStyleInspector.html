        <h2>The Style Inspector</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">The Style inspector controls all of the visual attributes of objects on the canvas. To open it, click the first tab in the inspector. If the inspector isn&rsquo;t open, choose <span class="Bold">Style</span> from the <span class="Bold">Inspectors</span> menu.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The Style inspector affects the objects you have selected on the canvas. If you have nothing selected, it instead affects the style of objects that will be created by the Draw tool.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Thickness</span> controls how thick a line is, or how big a point is. Drag the slider, or enter a precise value in the field. For lines and axes, the value in the field is an exact width in pixels. Points with the same Thickness value are considerably bigger, so that they are visible even when inside lines.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Color</span> sets the color of any selected object. Click the color well to use the standard Mac color picker. To the right is a slider for quickly making the color more transparent or opaque.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">Point Type determines whether to draw points as shapes, as ticks, as bars, or not at all. If you choose Shape, you can then specify which shape with the menu below. Ticks are short little lines that always draw perpendicular to the line they&rsquo;re on. Bars draw from the point to the <span class="Variable">x</span>- or <span class="Variable">y</span>-axis. Choose Hidden to prevent the points from appearing at all.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Shape</span> determines what shape the selected points should have.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Line Type</span> sets the way that the selected points are connected. Straight Segments connects one point to the next normally. Curved Segments calculates a smoothly flowing line between the points. <a href="help:anchor='bestfitline' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Best-Fit Line</a> uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_fit_line">linear regression equation</a> to calculate a slope that best describes the selected points.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Stroke</span> controls the style of line to draw between points. Choose from a variety of solid, dotted, dashed, or decorated strokes.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Arrowheads</span> puts a pointy end on the selected line or axis.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Label Text</span> is an easy way to add or change the label attached to the selected object.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Font</span> shows the font particulars for the selected text; click the button to open the standard Mac Font panel.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Font Size</span> offers a quick way to change text size without making a trip to the Font panel. Slide the slider, or type an exact value.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Distance</span> determines how far away a text label should be from the object it is attached to. This works for axis and tick labels, too.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Position</span> is a quick way to check or change the X, Y location of the selected object on the canvas.</span>                    </div>
