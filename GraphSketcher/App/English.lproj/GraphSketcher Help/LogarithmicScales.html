        <h2>Logarithmic Scales</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">Display your data powerfully with log scales on one or both axes. Specify your axis as logarithmic (or linear) in the <a href="help:anchor='axesinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Axes Inspector</a>. When creating log scales, there are a few things to keep in mind:</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">Zero is infinitely far away in logarithmic space, so the minimum and maximum values on a logarithmic axis must be values that are either both greater than zero or both less than zero. When switching from a linear axis to a logarithmic one, GraphSketcher automatically updates the values to avoid creating parameters that are mathematical impossibilities. Very large and small numbers will be represented in scientific notation, which you can find out more about in <a href="help:anchor='adjustingtheaxes' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Adjusting the Axes</a>.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">Lines in GraphSketcher are drawn to connect two or more data points as smoothly as possible. The underlying data points are mapped accurately to linear or logarithmic space, however, intermediate points are not comparable. To accurately map a line's shape between linear and logarithmic axes, choose <span class="Bold">Interpolate Line</span> from the <span class="Bold">Arrange</span> menu to sample the line's x-values. Upon switching to a logarithmic axis, each part of the shape adjusts to logarithmic space.</span>                    </div>
