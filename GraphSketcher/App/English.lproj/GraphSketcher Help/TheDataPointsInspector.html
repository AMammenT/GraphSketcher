        <h2>The Data Points Inspector</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">The Data Points inspector contains a table of all of the data in your graph. To open it, click the fourth tab in the inspector. If the inspector isn&rsquo;t open, choose <span class="Bold">Data Points</span> from the <span class="Bold">Inspectors</span> menu.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">For the most part, you can use this inspector like a miniature, minimally-featured spreadsheet; each row represents a point on the graph. Double-click a cell to add or edit a value. Press Tab to move to the next cell. To sort, click the header for the column you want to sort by. Anything you enter in the Label column is added as a text label for the corresponding point.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">What&rsquo;s especially useful is that you can copy and paste rows between this table and a spreadsheet, text editor, or outliner application. See the <a href="help:anchor='importing' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Importing</a> section for more details about sharing data with other applications.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">This inspector is also a handy way to select specific points. Any points you select in the table are also selected on the canvas.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">Connect Points</span> button is a shortcut for quickly connecting the selected points with a line; this is especially useful if you just pasted a bunch of data. This is also the easiest way to connect points in the order that they appear in the point list, rather than in left-to-right order.</span>                    </div>
