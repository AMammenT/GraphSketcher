                    <div class="item "><span class="">It&rsquo;s easy to keep track of multiple data sets in one GraphSketcher document.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">Sometimes you need to bring in data from another application, like a spreadsheet or text document. Simply select and copy all of the columns you'd like to bring to GraphSketcher and then paste them into your graph. GraphSketcher is pretty good at interpreting your data, and differentiates between these sets and turns each one into a locked group, assigning each group its own color and shape.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">If your data originates in GraphSketcher, you can use the same tricks to keep things organized. Select multiple points to <a href="help:anchor='group' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">group</a> or <a href="help:anchor='lock' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">lock</a> them, and use the <a href="help:anchor='styleinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Style inspector</a> to give them the same point type or to give their connecting line a distinctive stroke. </span>                    </div>
