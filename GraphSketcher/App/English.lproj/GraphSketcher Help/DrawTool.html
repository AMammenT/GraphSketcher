        <h2><span class="Drop">Drawing Lines and Points with the </span>Draw Tool</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/Draw.png" class="inline-image"></span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The Draw tool is how you sketch data, in the form of points, on the canvas. To get into Draw mode, just click the Draw button in the toolbar, or hold down the D key (the &ldquo;hot key&rdquo; for this tool). Draw mode lasts for as long as you hold down the key. As you use GraphSketcher more and more, you&rsquo;ll probably find that the hot keys are the quickest way to switch between tools.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">While in Draw mode, you have several ways of making points (and connecting them with lines):</span>                    </div>

                    <ul class="item List">                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">Double-click to create an individual point without any line attached. You can <a href="help:anchor='group' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">group</a> these and connect them with a line later, if you like.</span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">Click once for each point you want; the points are connected by a line. To make the last point, double-click. (With this method, you can hold Shift to constrain the angle of your line to 45-degree increments.)</span>                        </li>
                        <li class="item ListItem"><span class="">Drag across the canvas with the mouse button down to draw a line freehand. GraphSketcher does its best to create a smooth line that matches the one you drew.</span>                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">If you draw a point on top of an existing line or point, the two objects <a href="help:anchor='snap' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">snap</a> together. So, subsequently moving one of the objects will bring the other one along for the ride, unless you <a href="help:anchor='detach' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">detach</a> them.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">The lines and points you draw with the Draw tool follow the default styles defined by the <a href="help:anchor='styleinspector' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Style inspector</a>. To draw differently-styled objects, first deselect all objects on the canvas and then adjust the Style inspector to your liking. Any further objects you draw will match the new style settings.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">Once you&rsquo;ve created a line or a point, you can change it with the <a href="help:anchor='modifytool' bookID='GraphSketcher Help'">Modify tool</a>.</span>                    </div>
