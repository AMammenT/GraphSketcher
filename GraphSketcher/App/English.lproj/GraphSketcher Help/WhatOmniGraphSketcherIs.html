        <h2>What GraphSketcher Is</h2>
                    <div class="item "><span class="">GraphSketcher is unique in that it combines some features of illustration software with some features of data plotting software, so that you can create graphs really, really quickly.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">Ordinarily, if you wanted to sketch out a quick graph and have it look passably attractive, you&rsquo;d need to struggle against a drawing application that has no idea what axes or data sets are. Or, you&rsquo;d have to do battle with a spreadsheet or mathematics application that makes drawing anything feel like pulling teeth: even if you don&rsquo;t have specific data to plot, you need to make some up in order to illustrate your concept.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">GraphSketcher is a quick, straightforward tool for creating graphs, whether you have specific data to visualize or you just have a concept to explicate. And it doesn&rsquo;t assume that you have gobs of free time and attention to learn how to use it.</span>                    </div>

                    <div class="item "><span class="">For the most part, you should be able to click around and figure out for yourself how it works. If you get stuck, or you&rsquo;re just the sort of person who likes to read software documentation (hello!), go ahead and search this Help book.</span>                    </div>
